            Hi I’m Berrak. I was born and brought up in Turkey. I have studied Economics at Anatolian University and I always wanted to get a master's degree, so I followed my heart and came to London. I did my MBA at Brunel University. I really liked England and I worked here ever since. I have a digital marketing background and I’m looking for a new challenge and to improve my employability.<br><br>
            I'm a positive, happy and self-motivated person. Outside of work, I like to keep my self fit and active. I was a member of Virgin Active and a member of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) community choir, until the coronavirus pandemic started.

              Technology has made our lives easier, faster, and more comfortable, therefore the world becomes a better place to live. It is easier to communicate with people around the world through the internet, so I would like to be a part of projects, which have the social purpose of helping people particularly in times of stress. For instance, a number of good applications were developed to help people during the recent earthquake in Izmir, Turkey. It was quite fascinating to see how technology is helping people and saving lives.<br><br>
              Today coding has typically seen a men’s world, but it wasn’t the case in our early history. I am innovative, analytical and I enjoy problem-solving and love coding so far,  and I want to learn as much as I can and show that women can also code as well as men and I would really appreciate the chance to get on the course.

              I was trying to learn coding by myself and I have been looking forward to an opportunity like this, so I’m thankful that my work coach referred me to Founders and Coders.

              I have learned a lot during our group coaching sessions and group studies. It was quite intense and still a lot to learn, but when we got stuck our mentors were guiding, teaching, and encouraging us to continue. Collaborative learning is a part of this programme, I made very good friends. It was a great experience and I loved to be part of the community where everyone is helping each other.
